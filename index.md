# Cognitive computational neuroscience of speech recognition

We study the neural basis of language and speech.

When humans listen to speech, 
the acoustic signal that enters the ears is a complex pattern of air pressure fluctuations.
Yet, listeners intuitively and almost instantaneously experience meaning in these sounds. 
Our research focuses on the transformations that happen in the brain to enable this.
We also develop novel methods that allow us to study this, primarily with M/EEG.
