Speech signals are often acoustically ambiguous between multiple interpretations.
This is exacerbated by the presence of background noise, and hearing disorders.
A common strategy that listeners use in such situations is to use the linguistic context to fill in gaps in comprehension.
The goal of this project is developing and testing explicit models of context use in continuous speech, how context use changes with age, and how it interacts with hearing loss.
To test these models we will collect EEG and fMRI data, together with a range of cognitive and hearing related measures.

We have an opening for
a **graduate student** interested in 
computational models of human speech and language perception 
and their relationship to human speech processing, 
cognitive aging,
and neural data (EEG, functional and structural MRI).

The researcher will be part of multidisciplinary team including experts in Neuroscience, Hearing and Speech, Hearing Technology, and Aging. 
Team members include Ian Bruce (McMaster), Emily Myers and Thomas Hinchey (UConn) and Samira Anderson (U Maryland).

Openings:

 - Candidates interested in graduate programs can reach out to me to discuss suitability (we have rolling admissions and do not get notified automatically of [formal applications](https://applygrad.mcmaster.ca/portal/start_your_app))

This project is funded by [NIH](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/S0ABSkf4iE2GqIQnNxTKsg/project-details/10804052).
