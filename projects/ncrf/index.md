The primary goal is developing a user-friendly analysis pipeline for electrophysiological data (primarily MEG and EEG), based on the neuro-current response function method (introduced in [Das et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116528)). The focus of the analysis pipeline is to unveil how the human brain encodes complex and natural stimuli.

We are looking for applicants interested in theory and algorithm development, as well as development of a versatile data pipeline with user-friendly front-end and documentation. Development will be using public M/EEG datasets, which provides room to work on different topic areas, for example auditory and speech processing, emotion perception, external stimulus processing in patients undergoing anesthesia etc. Ideal candidates should have experience and interests in one or more of the following areas: signal processing; system identification; computational neuroscience; Python development; prior experience with MEG and/or EEG is not required but would be a plus.

The research fellows will work as a part of multidisciplinary team including PIs, postdoctoral researchers with Engineering, Neuroscience and Medicine background. Candidates will work primarily with Christian Brodbeck, PhD (McMaster), Proloy Das, PhD (Stanford) and Patrick L. Purdon, PhD (Stanford), but may also consult with a team with diverse topic interests in neuroscience, including Isabelle Buard, PhD (UofColorado), Monty Escab√≠, PhD (UConn) and Steven Stufflebeam, MD (MGH).

Formal announcement to follow. Feel free to reach out to us for further information (brodbecc@mcmaster.ca, proloy@stanford.edu, ppurdon@stanford.edu)
