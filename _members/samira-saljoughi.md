I am a first-year MASc student in Biomedical Engineering at McMaster University, working in cognitive and computational neuroscience of speech. 
In our research, we investigate the neural mechanisms underlying linguistic context use during speech processing in aging. 
Using EEG and fMRI, we develop and test computational models to understand how the brain leverages contextual information to resolve ambiguity in continuous speech, particularly in the presence of noise and hearing loss. 
My interests lie in the theoretical and computational principles that explain how the brain makes sense of complex, real-world communication.
