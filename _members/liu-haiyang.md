I am a second-year PhD student interested in human language processing and artificial language models. 
I am currently working on a project investigating morphological processing in deep language models and the human brain, aiming to use computational metrics from deep language models to facilitate the prediction of neural activity associated with human language processing and comprehension. 
Additionally, I work on unit-by-unit computational modeling of neuroimaging data, such as EEG and MEG, using the multivariate Temporal Response Function (mTRF) framework. 
Previously, I mainly worked on theoretical linguistics, such as interfaces between syntax, phonology, and morphology.
