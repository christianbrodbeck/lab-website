# Research Interests

Joshua is a PhD student at McMaster University in the School of Biomedical Engineering.
He is supervised by Dr. Christian Brodbeck.
His research focuses on how the brain processes speech in real-world listening environments.
This includes continuous, meaningful speech and speech presented in noisy backgrounds.
He uses EEG and computational modeling to study how the brain tracks speech signals in real time.
Joshua is especially interested in how these processes change with age and vary across individuals.
His work aims to understand the neural mechanisms that support speech comprehension in both quiet and noisy conditions.

Current areas of focus include:

- Developing custom tools for cognitive and auditory testing
- Building pipelines for EEG feature extraction, noise rejection, and decoding
- Investigating speech comprehension and predictive processing across time
- Analyzing background EEG activity (such as 1/f dynamics) to explore listening effort

Joshuaâ€™s goal is to create adaptive neurotechnologies.
These tools are designed to support people across a wide range of ages and cognitive profiles.
He is especially interested in making these technologies accessible to populations often underrepresented in neuroscience research.

# Background and Previous Experience

Before his PhD, Joshua developed EEG-based software including algorithms and applications for assessing cognitive processing in diverse populations such as athletes, first responders, and veterans.
His work bridges engineering and neuroscience, with a focus on practical, accessible solutions.
These skills now support his research on speech processing and brain function.
