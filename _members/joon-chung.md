I am a fourth year neuroscience student at Mcmaster University. 
I am researching how binaural cues are used in auditory stream segregation for speech perception, particularly in complex acoustic environments. 
I am interested in understanding how the brain processes speech and exploring treatments for neurodegenerative disorders.
