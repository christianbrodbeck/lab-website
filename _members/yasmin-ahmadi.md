I am a first-year Masterâ€™s student exploring computational neuroscience and bio-inspired artificial intelligence. 
I am working on how Genetic Programming, inspired by neurobiological principles, can be used to evolve predictive models for sequence prediction and speech recognition. 
My goal is to develop speech recognition models that adapt to diverse contexts while mirroring human-like processing.
